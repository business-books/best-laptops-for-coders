As developers, we don't need many tools to get the job done. Many will say that you just need a laptop or computer. Even if it's true, there's a difference between having the bare minimum you need to get the job done and having the tools to be comfortable, productive, and healthy.

Today we will talk about keyboards that you as a developer will love. The list I present is in no particular order and I will give you my personal opinion on keyboards and some facts.

What is the best keyboard? The one that suits you best!

With that said, let's jump right into the list.

Let's start with my favorite keyboard, the one I'm currently using for this article, the Keychron K6. I have the RGB version with gray keys and I love it. First, I like the format; 65% of the keyboard is the right size for me. I like the arrow keys, but I don't need a numeric keypad on the right, nor a separate place for the Home keys and page turning.

The keyboard is high quality, looks very solid and very comfortable, it is a little high and I recommend using a palm rest (I use their official palm rest which is all wood and pretty cool). It supports multiple Bluetooth devices and I use this feature every day as I use the keyboard on my personal laptop and work computer.

It has a large 4000 mAh battery, which allows a lot of time without charging, although I usually plug it into the mains, just for convenience.

The keys seem to fit me. I like that you have to press a little on the key to press it, and I like the movement of the keys. It makes me type much faster than other keyboards. Although, to be honest, I'm a big fan of gray keys in general.

One last thing, the keyboard supports Windows, Linux, and Mac, and even provides a different set of keys for Mac and Windows so you can customize it to your liking.
